This Smart Door Lock project aims to develop a secure and reliable smart lock system controlled remotely via a mobile phone. The system leverages an ESP32 microcontroller \cite{esp32-datasheet}, integrating a robust communication protocol and fault detection mechanism. The project is designed to meet the needs of modern smart homes by ensuring rapid response times and high security.

- \textbf{Software Systems Analysis:} Verification of system reliability using SSA tools.

- \textbf{Internet of Things:} Implementation on the ESP32 platform, utilizing IoT protocols for communication.
