The objective of this project is to develop a secure and reliable smart door lock system that can be remotely controlled. This system should provide real-time feedback on the door's status, ensuring that users are notified if the door is improperly secured. The solution aims to integrate fault detection mechanisms and secure communication protocols to enhance the system's reliability.
