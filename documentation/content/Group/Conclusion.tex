In conclusion, the Smart Door Lock project successfully demonstrated the integration of hardware and software technologies to create a secure, remote-controlled locking system. Leveraging the capabilities of the ESP32 microcontroller, MQTT communication, and sensor integration, we were able to develop a functional prototype that effectively meets the project's objectives. The system's design ensures reliable operation, with real-time status updates, fault detection mechanisms, and a responsive locking mechanism controlled via a mobile application. Through comprehensive testing and analysis, the system proved to be both reliable and efficient, making it a viable solution for enhancing home security in an IoT environment. The collaborative efforts of the team, combined with the application of knowledge from our courses, have resulted in a robust and well-documented project that meets the intended goals.
