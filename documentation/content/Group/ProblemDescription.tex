The project focuses on creating a smart door lock system that addresses the security challenges associated with remote access control. Traditional locks do not offer remote capabilities, and many existing smart locks lack robust security features. This project aims to overcome these issues by developing a system that can be controlled via a mobile application, with real-time alerts and fault detection to ensure that the door is always securely locked when it should be.
